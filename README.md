# Facade
A prototype for a retro-styled platformer. The player runs through a scarab beetle-infested obstacle course to reach an end. The game's controls are as follows
 - Left/Right arrows for horizontal movement;
 - Spacebar for jumping;
 - The X key for running;
 - Ctrl + C for toggling on and off the debug interface;
 - Ctrl + W for terminating the process;
 - Ctrl + Z for clearing the debug console.
